//when the module is loaded, during the bot's launch,
//this function is called.
//  utils is an object provided by the bot, constructed as follow:

//  Where:
//    'utils.settings.get(guild, field)' is a function you need to call when
//      you whant to access an saved object (json formatable) in this module's
//      persitent data.
//      Example: onlineRole= utils.settings.get(guild, 'online-role');
//    'utils.settings.set(guild, field, value)' is a function you need to call when

//      data.
//      Example: utils.settings.set(guild, 'number-of-cats', 5);

//       the 'clearance level' of a particular guild member. (see below for clearance level)
//    'utils.bot_uid' is the discord 'user id' of this bot.

//  - CLEARANCE_LEVEL.MASTER_ID = 0b100 = 4  - member is the bot's master
// A fourth level exists, used to contextualized a message:
//  - CLEARANCE_LEVEL.CONTROL_CHANNEL = 1  - posted in context of a 'control channel'

//  A clearance level of 7:
//    7 = 1+2+4 = CONTROL_CHANNEL+ADMIN_ROLE+MASTER_ID
