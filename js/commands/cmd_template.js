//CLEARANCE LEVEL:
// A particular member can have 3 different clearance level:
//  - CLEARANCE_LEVEL.NONE = 0 = 0b000 - no clearance level
//  - CLEARANCE_LEVEL.ADMIN_ROLE = 0b010 = 2  - member is recognized admin
//  - CLEARANCE_LEVEL.MASTER_ID = 0b100 = 4  - member is the bot's master
// A fourth level exists, used to contextualized a message:
//  - CLEARANCE_LEVEL.CONTROL_CHANNEL = 1 = 0b001 - posted in context of a 'control channel'
// Ofc, these level are stackable:
//  A clearance level of 7:
//    7 = 1+2+4 = 0b111 = CONTROL_CHANNEL+ADMIN_ROLE+MASTER_ID
//      is obtained when the master, who here is also an admin, posted a message in a
//      control channel

//    'utils.cache_message_management.untrack(msg)' is a function to call when you no longer need
